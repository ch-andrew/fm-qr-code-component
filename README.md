### What I learned

In the beginning I wanted to try something new with this project while still using basic html and css without any frameworks. So I decided to use Less CSS for styling, and enjoyed

```css
@border-radius: 12px;
@white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
@light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
@grayish-blue:hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
@dark-blue:hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
```
